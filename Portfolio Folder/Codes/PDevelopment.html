	<h3 align = center> SUMMARY </h3>
	<hr></hr>
	<p align = center> From what I gathered from the chapters recommended, The "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn
	and Chris Widener follows the story of Michael Jones, a man who seems to be at a
	dead-end in life who by chance meets Charlie, an old man who takes care of a mansion
	owned by a successful businessman named Mr. Davis, after his car broke down not too far
	in front of the mansion. Charlie, after listening to the problems and worries Michael faces
	in his life, imparts upon him knowledge he learned from the business mogal Mr. Davis on not 
	only how to be successful, but also how to become a better person. 
	These encounters with Charlie changes Michael's life for the better and the resulting
	friendship develops into a sort of father-son relationship between the two, but as the book
	continues, we witness the deteriorating health of Charlie. </p>

<h3 align = center> REFLECTION </h3><br>
	<hr></hr><p align = center> The more I read and immersed myself into interactions between Charlie and Michael, the more
	I was able to relate to the topics of discussion, but not necessarily in the way most might
	think. During the discussion between Charlie and Michael about those who surround you 
	influencing your attitude and behaviours, I couldn't help but think about my real life friendships.
	In general, I don't associate with many people who aren't goal-oriented or determined to strive, not
	by choice, but merely by coincidence. This may seem like a good thing, and in a way it is, but on the other hand
	I have come to realize that I myself might be the "bad company" in the scenario. By "bad company", I do not
	mean getting myself and those around me into trouble or anything like that, but the lack of motivation
	and consistency present in both my work ethic and hobbies, in other words, I'm pretty much a bum. An example of
	this would be something that I was once proud of, my skill with 3D software, when in truth, I have barely 
	done anything of note with it for the past two years! I am currently thinking of ways of remeding this
	issue, and this passage has given me a few ideas like reading more books to expand both my general knowledge
	and vocabulary as well as improve my attention span and memory, which I am afraid to admit has deteriorated ever since 
	the introduction of short-form content. Finally, as said by Charlie, I will be writing down certain 
	short-term goals in an attempt to complete them more effectively as it improves motivation and guides a path
	to larger, future successes. </p>
