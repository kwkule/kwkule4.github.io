&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Greetings</b>, my name is Kyle Warren, I am 19 years of age <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and attend the Montego Bay Community College.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The website
you are currently viewing is dedicated to my aspirations, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goals, dreams and present skillsets/experiences, that is, if I'll <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have any left by the time I'm finished with this course.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that you may learn
from reading this website as much as I have <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffered in making it. If you have any questions, I suggest <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you find someone less inept than
I am to answer them <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(which would NOT be very hard), but if you must ask,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b> click on my picture below </b>.
