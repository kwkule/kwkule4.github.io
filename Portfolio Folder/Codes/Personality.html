I believe my strongest trait to be my lack of certainty and confidence in my work
which has caused me to become dependent on others' help and opinions when the time comes to do assignments
even if the work I put in is satisfactory.

	<h3 align = center> BUT WHY HIM? </h3>
	<br>
	<hr></hr>
	<p align = center> Diogenes, also known as Diogenes of Sinope or the founder of cynicism, was a Greek philosopher born around 404 BC in Sinope, Anatolia.
	He was unlike other philosophers, in which, he was but a homeless beggar living inside of an old tub. Despite this, he was one of the most cocky/arrogant
	people I've ever heard of. He wasn't afraid to speak his mind despite his vulnerable living situation, and spouted some of the most absurd but humorous quotes
	in human history. Just a little anecdote about Diogenes: Alexander the Great upon hearing about him and his mad ramblings decided to take the time out
	his busy schedule to visit him because he was quite a fan of the madman. When Alexander asked if Diogenes desired anything, to which Diogenes replied
	(to the most powerful man in the world at the time, mind you) "Yes, I would like you to stand a little out of my sun." Absolute legend. I like this Diogenes 
	quote in particular though because despite his demeanor and status, it showed that he was but a humble beggar. </p><hr></hr>

<p align = center> The results from this personality test seem to reflect my personality very well, as I am mostly Introverted, Turbulent and make choices on observation rather than 
instinct/intuition. What I may not agree with are the prospecting and thinking results, as I am not very good at adapting to situations neither do lead mostly with logical thought
rather than emotion. </p>
